Create a gh-pages branch: GitHub Pages uses the gh-pages branch to serve your site.
git checkout -b gh-pages

Install GitHub Pages package: If you're using React (or other JavaScript frameworks), you need to install the gh-pages package:
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

Update package.json: In the package.json file, add the following properties:
"homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository-name",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

Build and Deploy: Now, run the deployment command:
npm run deploy
This will push your build to the gh-pages branch.

Visit your website: After deployment, visit your GitHub Pages URL (https://username.github.io/repository-name) to see your live site.
